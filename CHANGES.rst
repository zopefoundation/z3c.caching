2.0a1 - April 22, 2010
----------------------

* Added `Purge`` event and ``IPurgeable` and ``IPurgePaths`` interfaces.
  Although this package doesn't provide any purging support, it is convenient
  to keep the interfaces necessary for other packages to describe their cache
  purging behaviour here. This allows a relatively harmless dependency on
  z3c.caching, even in generic code, as distinct from a higher-level,
  application server specific framework.
  [optilude]

* Added concept of an explicitly declare ruleset type. Optional by default,
  but can be made required by setting `explicit` to `True`.
  [optilude]

* Added ``ILastModified`` implementation for a view which delegates to the
  view's context.
  [optilude]

* Added ``enumerateTypes()`` method to the registry, used to list all currently
  used cache rule ids.
  [optilude]

* Made the registry use the ZCA more directly.
